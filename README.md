## Features

- **Three Main Sections:**  
  - **Sidebar:** Displays contacts (hidden on mobile, accessible via a toggle button).  
  - **Chat Window:** Main conversation area with rich-text chat input and formatted messages.  
  - **AI Copilot:** AI-powered assistant that generates dynamic responses using predefined dummy data and randomization.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Fully responsive layout adapts to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
  - On mobile, the sidebar collapses into a toggle button for contacts, maximizing screen space.

- **Interactive Chat:**  
  - Rich text input with formatting options (bold, italic, copy to clipboard).  
  - Messages can be added from the chat window to AI Copilot input and vice versa by clicking a button.  
  - Smooth animations enhance user experience.

- **Dummy Data & Simulated AI:**  
  - Uses predefined conversations stored in JavaScript files.  
  - AI Copilot responses are randomly generated from dummy responses for demo purposes.
